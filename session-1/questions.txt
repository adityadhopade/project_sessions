1. Docker Architecture
2. How to convert Application code into Dockerfile
3. How to convert Dockerfile into a Docker container
4. Client to access docker resources 


My Questions:
1. One question regarding the basic architecture of K8's. [Reffering to the basic diagram ] We have only 1 etcd than other components in the master. Doesn't that serve a higher risk if it fails?

2. Also does a master node keep track of worker nodes present in it But does a worker node know about other worker nodes? is there any significance of worker-to-worker communication?
