1. How to set up a new k8s cluster on a remote server
2. What are the static pods that come up even without the DNS pod
3. How to install CNI 
4. What is needed for the container n/w to work
5. Which clients did you use to connect to the API server


1. In the basic architecture of K8s. [Reffering to the basic diagram ] We have only 1 etcd than other components in the master. Doesn't that serve a higher risk if it fails?

2. Also does a master node keep track of worker nodes present in it But does a worker node know about other worker nodes? is there any significance of worker-to-worker communication?

3. Can we make the pods in any containerization Tool?
